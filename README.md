# TicTacToe Project

This project will produce a text-based, multi-player tic-tac-toe game.

You will need to meet 6 checkpoints for this project before you can develop your final solution. When you complete a checkpoint, make a commit with the comment "Checkpoint #N Complete" where N is the checkpoint number. Checkpoints will be graded on a pass/fail basis (with an early-pass and a late-pass as a possibility) and you must pass a checkpoint in order to receive unit tests and instructions for the next checkpoint. An early pass will earn you 100% for the checkpoint. An on-time pass will earn credit for a low A (90%). A late pass will earn credit for a low B (80%). You may not work ahead on checkpoint requirements beyond the checkpoint you are currently working on and doing so will result in not passing your current checkpoint. You must strictly follow the instructions in the checkpoint in order to pass -- simply passing the unit tests does not mean you will pass the checkpoint. 

Grading comments will be left on the most recent commit by the deadline. Not passing a checkpoint means you will need to make another commit correcting your mistakes from the prior grading comments before you can proceed to the next checkpoint. Checkpoints will be graded following Tuesday and Friday commits (last commit before 6PM) and a maximum of two checkpoints a week may be passed. When a checkpoint is passed, make sure to perform a pull or download the content of your repository in order to receive the newest unit tests and instructions. Checkpoints that are not passed before the final due date will not receive credit (again, you must pass through them sequentially without working ahead of your current checkpoint and you may only pass through a maximum of two a week). You may receive partial credit for the last checkpoint you attempted but did not pass. Don't alter any file other than TicTacToe.java. 

Here are the checkpoint due dates for the project and very brief descriptions of the tasks:

1. Drawing the board: (early: on or before 6pm 1/19, late: after 6pm 1/26)
2. Tracking moves with variables: (early: on or before 6pm 1/26, late: after 6pm 2/2)
3. User initialization of board state: (early: on or before 6pm 2/2, late: after 6pm 2/9)
4. Allow users to make a move: (early: on or before 6pm 2/9, late: after 6pm 2/16)
5. Determine a winner: (early: on or before 6pm 2/16, late: after 6pm 2/23)
6. Take turns making moves: (early: on or before 6pm 2/23, late: after 6pm 3/1)

Checkpoints will not be graded after 6PM on 3/22 and your last commit before this deadline will be used for the purposes of determining the final project grade. Additional instructions for your final commit will be posted after you pass checkpoint #6.

## Checkpoint #1 Instructions

Write some print statements in your main method that use spaces, |, and - symbols to print an empty tic-tac-toe board. Include dots for each empty spot on the board (including the empty spots in the third column). When you're finished, your program should print exactly what is below. 

	.|.|.

	.|.|.

	.|.|.

When your code is passing the unit tests, make a commit with the comment "Checkpoint #1 Complete". 

**Due dates: early on or before 6pm 1/19, late after 6pm 1/26, no credit after 6PM on 3/22**
